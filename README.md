# Interplanetary Broadcast System (IBS)
An interplanetary broadcasting system to send messages to different planets using publish subscribe design. The (.exe) file is included in case the powershell is not working properly as expected. [Note: I'm aware it's not a good practice]

## Setup Guide
1. Right click ClickMe.ps1 > **Run with Powershell** to build and run the console application
2. After building, the application will be executed.
3. Choose satelite to broadcast message with.
4. Then type in your message that you wish to broadcast. Then message will then be received by radar that subscribed to the satelite.
5. "Q" or "q" will quit the application.
